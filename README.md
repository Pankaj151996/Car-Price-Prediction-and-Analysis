# Car-Price-Prediction-and-Analysis

# Overview

This project analyzes car price data to identify key factors affecting pricing and build a predictive model. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier analysis, and machine learning models for price prediction.

# Features

Data Processing: Loading and cleaning car price dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends, distributions, and correlations.

Outlier Analysis: Identifying and handling anomalies.

Machine Learning Models: Building regression models to predict car prices.

Performance Evaluation: Comparing model accuracy and effectiveness.

# Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

# Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git

Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute data analysis and model training.

# Dataset

The dataset contains car listings with various attributes like year, brand, mileage, fuel type, and price. Ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory before running the notebook.

# Results

Visualizations showing price trends and influencing factors.

A trained model capable of predicting car prices based on input features.
